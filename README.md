I am a hands-on software development leader with 20+ years of experience. Cloud, Agile and DevOps transformations are my bread and butter, helping businesses succeed at their strategic goals is my passion. Since 2012, I have been focused on leading the development of public facing, cloud based applications using Microsoft Azure technologies.
